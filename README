CauseWhyNot - CauseWay stub dumper. 

This project dumps the causeway dos extender stub. It might not work, im not sure. 

It assumes that the linker used linearly links causeway at the start, which might not be the case all the time.


Options
=======

First argument is the input filename - include extension
Second argument is output stub filename
Optional - third argument is the left of the binary after the stub
