CauseWhyNot - CauseWay stub tool.

----------MAIN.PY----------
Dumps the CauseWay stub off of an executable.
Dumped stub can be linked using watcom. 


Options
=======

First argument is the input filename - include extension
Second argument is output stub filename
Optional - third argument is the left of the binary after the stub



----------REBUILD.PY----------
Grafts a stub onto a dumped executable (preferably one dumped using main.py option 3)
I cannot guarantee this will work, so use at your own risk.
I could not test it, so oh well.
Also, you need the new stub to be <= the size of the old stub.

Options
=======

First option is the input executable filename
Second option is the stub filename
Third option is the output executable filename
Optional - fourth argument is the size the stub should be.
	 - This is there if the size of the stub you are using is smaller than it should be
	 - To maintain all offsets, it will pad the end of the stub with nops
